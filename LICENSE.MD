The license for publications in this repo varies and is included with each publication in the appropriate sub-directory.

To be safe, the default license (when no explicit license is included) is 
"personal, read only": no distribution or derivatives permitted. However, please feel
free to ask if you like to distrbute or create a derivative of any content that does not
have an associated license.
