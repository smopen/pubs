# An Introduction to Positional Number Systems

*Author: Sean Murthy*

This article is a gentle tutorial-style introduction to positional number systems. It introduces simple concepts such as digits, base, significance, place value, and conversion to decimal system.   

This tutorial was originally designed for students of [CS140](https://sites.wcsu.edu/murthys/teaching/cs140/), an introductory programming course at Western Connecticut State University. However, **the content is completely unrelated to programming**, and can be used by high school students, regardless of their interest in programming.

At Western, this tutorial is handed to students on the first day of the term and is made due the next time the class meets. The advantage of this approach is that students are introduced to concepts that are routinely objects of programming exercises: finding the least/most significant digit, extracting digits, counting the number of digits, summing up digits, and conversion between bases. The tutorial is also helpful in  later phases when students perform bit-level operations such as shifting and masking. (This tutorial is also handed to students of [CS170](https://sites.wcsu.edu/murthys/teaching/cs170/) which is a second programming course.)

Having  students learn these concepts on their own (at least initially) at the start of term  decouples the math from programming which  makes it easier to learn the concepts. The approach also has the advantage of saving considerable class time.
