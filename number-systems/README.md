# An Introduction to Positional Number Systems

*Author: [Sean Murthy](https://smurthys.github.io/)*

This article is a gentle tutorial-style introduction to positional number systems.
It introduces simple concepts such as digits, base, significance, place value, and
conversion to decimal system. It also includes simple exercises to reinforce each
concept introduced. 

This tutorial is designed for students of any introductory programming course.
However, **the content is completely unrelated to programming**, and can be used by
high school students, regardless of their interest in programming.

I hand this tutorial to students on the first day of the term and make it due the
next time the class meets. The advantage of this approach is that students are
introduced to concepts that are routinely objects of programming exercises:
finding the least/most significant digit, extracting digits, counting the number of
digits, summing up digits, and conversion between bases. The tutorial is also helpful
in later phases when students perform bit-level operations such as shifting and masking. 
(I also hand this tutorial to students of second programming course.)

Having  students learn these concepts on their own (at least initially) at the start
of term  decouples the math from programming which  makes it easier to learn the concepts.
The approach also has the advantage of saving considerable class time.
